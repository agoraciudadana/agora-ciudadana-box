# List of things left TODO

* create an election in agora-ciudadana and use it in agora-election when aelection is enabled. this is needed, because otherwise when aelection is enabled the deploy will give always an error, as aelection will never start, so the DB won't be created, etc.

* fix httpauth and enable_aelection overlap

* deploy an email server securely

* explain how to manually change from httpauth to no httpauth to go live
